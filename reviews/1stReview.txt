Advantages and Disadvantages (150-300 words):
1. Advantages:
a) Callback function:
The wide application of callback function can help a lot in the capsulation.
For example, we find that the function ``` NewTicker ``` can be used as
interfaces for other functions, which can help a lot the implementation of
process start and process termination.

b) Use tickers to memorize the rumor mongering status:
Also, as mentioned above, because there is tickers to memorize the launch and termination
of a process, we can take advantage of this to implement the process of rumor mongering.


c) Accelerate the process of information exchange:
I think this one is quite good, as I did not implement this way. In this way, the efficiency
of the information exchange is higher because of this. When receiving the status packet, this
code compares it with local wantlist. In this way, during one receipt of status packet, the gossiper
not only send the status packet to the sender if he has found that some of the packets have been missed,
but also, if there are some rumors that the sender missed, it can also start rumormongering to the sender
with the missing rumor.

2. Disadvantages:
a) The design of the lock:
All of the locks used as a member of gossiper object, it may perhaps cause the lock of the whole object.
I think this could be the reason why there is deadlock for the tick checking. It will be a better design
that the lock can be put inside the member of the object 'gossiper'.

For example:
LastSent and LastSentLock can be combined as
LastSentObject {
    LastSent map[string]*hu.RumorMessage
    LastSentLock sync.RWMutex
}

Advantages and Disadvantages (150-300 words):
Advantages:
a) Very good OOP design
In this implementation, the most attractive point for me is that the members of gossiper have been modulized, such as
peerBook and database which is used to record the data. It will be easy to develop other features in the future.
What is more, it is also convenient for the test, e.g. in this implementation, we have database_test, daemons_test and 


b) 

c) Clear logger:
Compared with other implementations, the most impressive feature of this implementation is the clear logging.
There is a logger object. And each object can have a logging member, which is much more easier for the record.
